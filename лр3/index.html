                A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
                operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
                These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete"
                computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed
                and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and
                function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
                A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
                special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices
                like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal
                computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links hundreds of
                millions of other computers and users.

                A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to
                simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio
                frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link
                establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to
                the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network
                architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones in North
                America. In addition to telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other services, such
                as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared,
                Bluetooth), business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only
                those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing
                capabilities are referred to as smartphones.[1]
